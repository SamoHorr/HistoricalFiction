Finalist of the National Book Award author Rachel Kushner, once described as “One of the most brilliant writers of the new century” by Robert Stone, wrote The Flamethrowers, an engaging novel that follows a female artist in the 1970s. We follow Reno, a young bold artist as she joins a group of dreams and raconteurs. Kushner drew inspiration from her own personal experience as well as her interest in “motorcycles”, art, revolution, and radical politics. The best two words that describe this novel are ‘thrilling’ and ‘fearless’, a major American novel written by an author with spectacular talent and imagination.
