A book that best blends historic fiction with ancient myth and magic is Once a Monster by Robert Dinsdale. This book is a reimagining of the famous legend of the Minotaur set in Victorian London in 1861. Ten-year-old orphan Nell works with a crew of mudlarks who work on a stretch of the river. Nell spends her days searching for treasure in the mud until one day she stumbles upon a body on the shore. It wasn't her first encounter with a corpse, but it was the strangest one as this figure was a seven foot matted creature with horns.
