Yours Cheerfully by AJ Pearce set in 1940s, England during the World War II, despite the dire, horrifying and appalling circumstances of that time it is a heartwarming and uplifting historical fiction that focuses on Emmeline Lake, a young wartime advice columnist who must make a difficult decision between fulfilling her duty or support her friends. A perfect wartime story without any major violence or gruesomeness. “Of course I would never write something like that, but I found it frustrating to write encouraging articles, while knowing my friends weren’t being listened to in real life.” ― A.J. Pearce, Yours Cheerfully.
