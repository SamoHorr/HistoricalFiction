Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi, set in Ghana eighteenth century: we follow two half sisters born into different villages each unaware of each other. One will marry an Englishman and will lead a life of comfort and privilege in the palatial rooms of the Cape Coast Castle. The other sister will be captured during a raid on her village and enslaved in the very same castle.
With Homegoing we will follow the parallel paths taken by both sisters and their descendants through eight generations. Yaa Gyasi's extraordinarily brilliant writing illuminates’ slavery’s deep impact on the memory and soul of a nation.
