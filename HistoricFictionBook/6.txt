The most interesting way to learn about King Arthur and his legendary knights and their fellowship is with the book named King Arthur and his Knights of the round table by Roger Lancelyn Green. This book is a reimagination of the Arthurian legends intended for children.
Green manages to intertwine different Arthurian poems and folktales with Sir Thomas Mallory’s chronicle ‘’Le Morte d ’Arthur’ to tell the story of King Arthur’s rise to power in Camelot and his quest of the Holy Grail through one narrative. While also incorporating some mystic magic by adding the wizard Merlin to the story.
