The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco, the year is 1327 a wealthy Italian is suspected of heresy and Brother William of Baskerville arrives to investigate. But when his mission is suddenly overshadowed by seven bizarre deaths, Brother William must turn into a detective. He collects evidence and deciphers secret symbols and coded manuscripts as he digs into the eerie labyrinth of the abbey where “the most interesting things happen at night.”
“Show not what has been done, but what can be. How beautiful the world would be if there were a procedure for moving through labyrinths.”- Umberto Eco.
