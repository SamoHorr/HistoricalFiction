How Much of These Hills Is Gold is the debut novel of the Asian American author C Pam Zhang. The novel is divided into four parts and set during the California Gold Rush and takes place throughout 25 years between 1842 and 1867. The events in the book don’t take place in chronological order as the book begins in 1862 and goes back and forth in time. It is mainly narrated by a third-person narration from the viewpoint of 12-year-old orphan Lucy, but the perspective shifts to a first-person perspective of Lucy’s dead father in Part 3 of the book.
