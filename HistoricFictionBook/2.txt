The Maiden by Kate Foster is a thrilling historical murder tale inspired by a real-life case from the seventeenth century Edinburgh. This tale is loosely based on an actual real-life murder committed in 1679, it tells the story of fictional character Lady Christina, a married woman living a life of privilege that was arrested on the charge of murdering her lover, James Forrester. A passage that best fits to describe this remarkable book is “this I have learned for myself: girls who are wronged can become vengeful women. And it matters not whether they are ladies or harlots or maids.”
