Homecoming is a historical mystery novel from the best-selling author Kate Morton. The story begins with a crime, a crime so shocking its effects ripple through several generations. As Nora travels back to Sydney to take care of her grandmother whose health has declined, she discovers that her grandmother was hiding a dark family secret. A secret that involves a police investigation into a crime that happened sixty years ago: the Turner Family Tragedy of Christmas Eve, 1959. “Overall, exquisitely written, atmospheric and immersive, Homecoming by Kate Morton is an intricately woven story that I would not hesitate to recommend.”
