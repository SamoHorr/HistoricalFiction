"Ten days after the war ended, my sister drove a car off the bridge." That is how the book The Blind Assassin by Margaret Atwood begins.
Those words are spoken by Iris who recounts the death of her sister Laura in 1945 which was believed to be accidental. Then suddenly we are introduced to another story of two unnamed lovers who meet in dingy backstreet rooms. When we return to Iris it is through a newspaper article announcing the death of her husband, a distinguished industrialist.
The Blind Assassin is a deeply layered complex story that unfolds layer by layer.
