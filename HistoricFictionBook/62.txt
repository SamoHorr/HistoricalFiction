The Game of Kings by Dorothy Dunnett is an extraordinary novel with the main plot about an antihero that returns to the country that has outlawed him, Scotland, to redeem his reputation and save his home even at the risk of his life.
It is 1547 and Scotland has been humiliated and threatened by an English invasion, but it is still free. Paradoxically, her freedom may depend on a man who stands accused of treason, Francis Crawford of Lymond. “I despised men who accepted their fate. I shaped mine twenty times and had it broken twenty times in my hands.”
