Charles Dickens is mostly known for his famous book “Moby Dick”, but another classic written by Charles Dickens is “A Tale of Two Cities”. The book was set during the French Revolution in the mid to late nineteenth century during a turbulent and chaotic time for Europe. We follow the life of the heroine Lucie Manette, her previously imprisoned revolutionary father, her exiled aristocratic suitor, and his romantic rival. This book contrasts how modernization revealed the big gap between the rich and the poor and highlights the horrific social injustices and inequality that people lived through in that time period.
