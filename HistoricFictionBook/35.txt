The Signature of All things by Elizabeth Gilbert follows the extraordinary Whittaker family but more specifically Henry Whittaker and his daughter Alma whose life took a real rags to riches scenario. Henry, born a poor Englishman, makes a great fortune in South America during the quinine trade and eventually becomes the richest man in Philadelphia. Alma becomes a botanist of considerable gift who falls in love with a man who makes incomparable paintings of orchids. Two complete opposites, a utopian artist and a clear-minded scientist attracted together by their desperate need to understand how the world works and its meaning.
