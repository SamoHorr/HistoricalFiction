The Fair Fight set in 1800s England, talks about the story of two women. Ruth, a girl born in a brothel, who unlike her sister with her good looks could afford some comfort, her harsh looks set her on a path of drudgery. Pushed by a patron into a ring she discovers her true calling â€“ bare knuckle fighting in the prize rings of Bristol. And about Manor-born Charlotte who is scarred by smallpox and stifled by her social and romantic options is desperate for an escape. After a fight that sidelines Ruth, the women meet and alter each other's perspectives.
