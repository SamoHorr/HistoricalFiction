Doc by Mary Doria is the story of Dr. John Henry Holliday, a Southern gentleman born on the Texas frontier. A frail twenty-six-year-old dentist is hoping the dry air of the West will restore his health. Doc Holliday teams up with part time policeman named Wyatt Earp after the burned body of a mixed-blood boy named Johnnie Sanders is discovered. Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp names are forever linked in the American frontier mythology with the infamous gunfight at the O.K Corral. Inspired by real life people Doc is a retelling of events that  is filled with humor and compassion.
