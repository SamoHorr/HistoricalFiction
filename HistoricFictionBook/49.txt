      All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr centers around the connection between a blind French girl Marie-Laure LeBlanc and a German boy, Werner Pfenning and their journey through occupied France during World War II. The point of view alternates between Marie-Laure LeBlanc and Werner Pfenning between chapters and takes place during the Battle of Saint-Malo in august 1944 littered with chunks of time from 1934 going up. “Open your eyes and see what you can with them before they close forever.” “Don’t you want to be alive before you die?”― Anthony Doerr, All the Light We Cannot See.
