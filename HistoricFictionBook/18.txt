The Far Pavilions is a story of 19th Century India, it is a story about an English man that was brought up as Hindu and about his passionate but dangerous love for an Indian princess.
It is a complex but epic novel with a mix of history, adventure, and romanticism, a story that tells the tale of divided loyalties, of greedy imperialism and of the clash between the east and the west. This book had more than two million copies sold, deservedly so because as Paul Scott said it is “A great Romantic adventure novel. She is a born storyteller”.
