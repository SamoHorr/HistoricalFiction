The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern was nominated for the Favorite Book of 2011 and for the Best Fantasy 2011.
It tells us the story of the mystique circus named “Le Cirque des Reves” a circus that arrives without warning as if it magically appears, within the black-and-white striped canvas tents is an utterly unique breathtaking experience, but the catch is the circus is only open at night.
But behind the scenes it isn’t as lovely and charming as the viewers think, instead it is full of fierce competition, we follow the duel between two young magicians Celia and Marco.
