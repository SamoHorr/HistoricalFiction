The Things We Didn’t Know by Elba Iris Perez is a cross-cultural coming of age debit novel that explores a young girl’s – nine years old Andrea Rodrigues - childhood between 1950s Puerto Rico and a small Massachusetts factory town.
Andrea and her brother Pablo are sent to their family in the mountainside villages of Puerto Rico for months. After they finally return to Massachusetts, they find that their hometown has significantly changed. We follow the siblings, the American culture and the harsh realities of growing up.
“A coming-of-age tale that beautifully evokes the contrasting environments of Puerto Rico and Massachusetts.”
