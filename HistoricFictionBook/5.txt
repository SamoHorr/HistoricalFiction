The lamplighters written by Emma Stonex a hauntingly tragic tale shrouded in mystery inspired by true life events the Eilean Mor lighthouse mystery. Reimagined in Cornwall 1972 where from a remote lighthouse mile from shore three keepers disappear from. The lamplighters give a voice to the struggles of the woman the three keepers left behind. A snippet that perfectly sums it up “What strange fate befell these doomed men? The heavy sea whispers their names. Black rocks roll beneath the surface, drowning ghosts. And out of the swell like a finger of light, the salt-scratched tower stands lonely and magnificent.”
