March is a Pulitzer winning novel by acclaimed author Geraldine Brooks. It is a retelling of Louisa May Alcott’s famous novel Little Women, but this retelling is from the point of view of the protagonist's absent father. It gives us the story of the absent father and conjures a new world. This novel explains the events surrounding March’s absence during the American Civil War in 1862. “You go on. You set one foot in front of the other, and if a thin voice cries out, somewhere behind you, you pretend not to hear, and keep going.”
― Geraldine Brooks, March
