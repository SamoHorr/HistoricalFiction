Sisters of Fortune by USA Today bestselling Anna Lee Huber is a historical novel based on the true story of the Fortune sisters , three young women – Flora, Alice and Mabel Fortune - each at a crossroad when they board the RMS Titanic in the spring of 1912, the fateful voyage that would change their lives in profound and unexpected ways.
Each sister grapples with the choices before her as the grand and majestic vessel glides through the Atlantic waters.
Taking on such a well-documented subject to produce a fresh, new story requires some courage, and Huber’s success is evident.
