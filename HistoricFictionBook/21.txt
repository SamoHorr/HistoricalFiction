Ursula K. Le Guin is usually known by her revolutionary work in fantasy, but with her book Lavinia she also proved she is a master in the historical fiction genre also. Lavina is a breathtaking retelling of the Trojan War and its consequential founding of Rome. Le Guin changes Lavina story as just a silent figure, only meant to marry the hero Aeneas and stand by him as he builds the roman empire. By giving Lavinia a richer inner life and awareness of the deceit and tricks happening around her, she was rebranded to more than just a mere princess.
