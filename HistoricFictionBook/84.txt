Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen is a beautifully written story of a love between two people that overcomes incredible odds in a world in which love is a luxury only a few can afford.
When Jacob Jankowski suddenly becomes orphaned, he jumps onto a passing train, with this one jump he enters a world of drifters and misfits of a second-rate circus struggling during the Great Depression. Being a veterinary student Jacob is put in charge of caring for the circus menagerie.
There Jacob meets Marlena, the beautiful young star of the equestrian act, and Rosie, an untrainable elephant.
