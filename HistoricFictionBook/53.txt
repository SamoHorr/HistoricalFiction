If you want to read a book that will whisk you away into a world of gowns, glitz, and glamor. The Last Dance of the Debutante by Julia Kelly is the book to read. Julia’s newest historical fiction is set in 1958 London as we follow the last debutante season and the three girls that participated. An unlikely group of friends that have nothing in common but the fact that they were the last three debutantes to have curtsied and been presented to Queen Elizabeth II. “This story takes place in the fashionable swirl of London’s upper crust in 1958.”
