Beloved by American novelist Toni Morrison is a 1987 novel. Set in the period after the American Civil War, the novel tells the story of a dysfunctional family of formerly enslaved people who live in a Cincinnati home which is haunted by a malevolent spirit. Morrison’s inspiration for the book came from an account of events titled “A Visit to the Slave Mother who Killed Her Child”. Of a mother that barricaded herself with her children in a cabin and attempted to kill her children and herself to escape slavery, she managed to kill her youngest before she was stopped.
