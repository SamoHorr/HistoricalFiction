The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini is set in 1970s Afghanistan where a twelve-year-old Amir is desperate to win the local kite-fighting tournament with his loyal friend Hasan who promised to help him. But neither one of the boys could’ve foreseen what would happen to Hassan that afternoon by an event that shattered their lives. After the Russians invade and the family are forced to flee to America, Amir realizes he must return to Afghanistan to find his redemption.
“it always hurts more to have and lose than to not have in the first place.”― Khaled Hosseini, The Kite Runner
