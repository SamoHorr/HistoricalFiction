The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue by V.E. Schwab, nominated for Best Fantasy in 2020, is set in France, 1714 where a young woman in a moment of desperation makes a Faustian bargain to love forever and is cursed to be forgotten by everyone she meets.
Addie’s journey of dazzling adventure will play out across centuries and continents for nearly 300 years until one day a young man in a hidden bookstore remembers her name.
“...it is sad, of course, to forget.
 But it is a lonely thing, to be forgotten.
 To remember when no one else does.”- V.E. Schwab.
