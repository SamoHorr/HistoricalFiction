Midnight’s Children by Salman Rushdie is a historical fiction that mixes India’s historic moment in history with a touch of fantasy and magic. The main character Saleem Sinai born at the stroke of midnight on August 15, 1947, was born at the very moment when India managed to gain its independence from the British. Saleem’s birth was met with fireworks and cheering crowds but as he grew up, he realized the terrifying consequence of the timing of his birth. His life was inseparable from the state of his country while also telepathically linking him to the 1000 other “midnight’s children”.
