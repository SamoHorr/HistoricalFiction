Colson Whitehead’s The Nickel Boys classic novel that discusses heavy topics about another horrifying strand of American history. The Nickel Boys talks about the story of two boys sent to a hellish reform school in 1960s Florida, The Nickel Academy.
Which parades itself as a reform school that provides its students with ‘physical, intellectual and moral training’ but in reality it is a horror show filled with physical, emotional and sexual abuse.
In this novel we follow Elwood a young idealistic boy and Turner a skeptic and how the contrast and tension of each of their belief caused decade-long repercussions
