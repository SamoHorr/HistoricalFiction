The Night Watch is a uniquely written book that allows the reader to time travel as the book first starts in 1947 and ends in 1941. It is a novel that dives headfirst into the aftermath of World War II and its effects on four characters Kay, Helen, Viv and Duncan. Four complete strangers united by their traumatic experiences of the war and the strangeness of having to search for new meaning after the dust settles.
The Night Watch isnâ€™t only a novel about the war, it is a story of love and loss during a chaotic time in history.
