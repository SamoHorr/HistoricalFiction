The book is a collection of historical and autobiographical stories divided into two parts. The first part narrates the lives of members of the Laidlaw branch of the author’s family tree while the second part consists of fictionalized tales inspired by events in her own life.
“I know how you love this place," he says to me, apologetically yet with satisfaction. And I don't tell him that I am not sure now whether I love any place.”
