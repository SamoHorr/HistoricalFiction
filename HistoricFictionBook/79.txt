Bernard Cornwell’s writing in the Agincourt was reviewed by the Observer as “Cornwell’s narration is quite masterly and well researched.”
Agincourt is one of the epic battles of history.
“For an instant there was silence. Then the arrows struck. It was the sound of steel on steel. A clatter, like Satan’s hailstorm.”
 ― Bernard Cornwell, Agincourt.
A battle fought by two badly matched armies that met under atrocious conditions on St Crispin’s Day 1415 which resulted in an extraordinary victory for the English. A victory so grand that different versions appeared, Bernard will tell the true story behind the myths.
