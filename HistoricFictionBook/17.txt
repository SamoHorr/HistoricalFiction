Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer portrait of the anonymous Girl with a Pearl Earring has managed to bring awe and fascination for centuries in all types of viewers. Tracy Chevalier, one of these inspired viewers and intrigued by the ambiguous look on the girl’s face, a look Tracy described in her book as “But there are things inside you. I see them sometimes, hiding in your eyes.”. And decided to bring the “story behind that look” to life in her own fictional account of what took place back in 17th century Delft that led to the creation of this famous portrait.
