The Nightingale by Kristin Hannah “An unforgettable portrait of love and war” – People 
“In love we find out who we want to be. 
In war we find out who we are”
The Nightingale tells the story of two sisters separated by years and experience, by ideals and passion each embarking on their own dangerous journey of survival, love and freedom in a German-occupied, war-torn France. “If I have learned anything in this long life of mine, it is this: in love we find out who we want to be; in war we find out who we are.”
― Kristin Hannah.
