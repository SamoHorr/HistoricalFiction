The Moor's Account by Laila Lalami brings us the fictionalized and imagined memoirs of the first black explorer of America: Mustafa al Zamori: called Estebanico. A slave of a Spanish conquistador, Estebanico sailed for America with his master, Dorantes, as part of an expedition. Within a year, Estebanico is one of the four crew members to survive.
During his journey across America with his Spanish companions, Estebanico manages to remake himself as an equal, erasing the old roles of slave and master. “To overcome my fear, I shackled myself with hope, its links heavier than any metal known to man.”
