Ragtime by E.L. Doctorow, set in New York in the 1900s, managed to redefine the historical fiction genres with the way he mixes both very real and very fictional characters in the early 20th century New York landscape centered around a wealthy family. The novel was a winner of the National Book Critics Circle Awards, and the book was even adapted into a movie that manages to engage your intellect while entertaining you at the same time. “It is the law of wealth that such people only profit from the money that is taken from them.”
― E.L. Doctorow, Ragtime
