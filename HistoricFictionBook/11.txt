From the author of the number one best seller ‘The song of Achilles’ Madeline Miller comes another enchanting story named Galatea. A retelling of the Greek myth of Pygmalion and Galatea, it is a quite known and popular story where a sculptor falls in love with his own sculpture and his wish for his creation to come to life comes true. But this time we hear the story from the perspective of Galatea and about her own wants, desires, and turmoil. A downhearted quote from the book that describes Galatea’s situation perfectly is “Everyone would be happy, except for me”.
