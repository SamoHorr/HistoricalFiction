“I’m wondering if you still think of her as a monster. I suppose it depends on what you think that word means. Monsters are, what? Ugly? Terrifying? Gorgons are both these things, certainly, although Medusa wasn’t always. Can a monster be beautiful if it is still terrifying? Perhaps it depends on how you experience fear and judge beauty.” – Natalie Haynes, Stone Blind. Stone Blind is a novel retelling of the infamous Greek myth of the vilified gorgon Medusa but with a fresh new take on what happened to her. Nominated for the best fiction book at the British Book Awards.
