Pride and Prejudice is one of Jane Austen's most famed works. Jane Austen called this book “her own darling child” and describes her heroine Elizabeth Bennet “"as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print.” The story follows the tumultuous romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr Darcy.
“You are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. My affections and wishes are unchanged; but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever.”
