Nefertiti by Michelle Moran tells the story of the famous queen of Ancient Egypt Nefertiti but with a twist. This retelling of the great royal wife of Pharaoh Akhenaten includes her younger sister Mutnodjmet.
Mutnodjmet in this retelling plays a crucial role in the events that unfolded during Ancient Egypt as her loyalty to Nefertiti made her the only person brave enough to warn her sister of the priest's plot against her husband’s rule. “Nothing is forever...nothing lasts.” ― Michelle Moran, Nefertiti.  Filled with betrayal, love, political unrest and religious conflict Nefertiti brings ancient Egypt to life in vivid detail.
