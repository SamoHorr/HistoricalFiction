The Wreath by the Norwegian Nobel laureate in literature Sigrid Undset is the first book of a series named “Kristin Lavransdatter”, a series that had its readers in its hold throughout generations since its first publication in 1927.  “No one and nothing can harm us, child, except what we fear and love.” This quote best encapsulates the essence of the book as it is a historical romance fiction about the heroine Kirstin -   strong willed, beautiful, and passionate - romance with a dashing young man named Erlend Nikulausson that her father disapproves of because of his overly fondness of woman.
