The Lost Apothecary by Sarah Penner, is the story of a female apothecary that secretly dispenses poisons to help liberate woman from the men who have wronged them – setting three lives across centuries on a dangerous collision.
“Rule #1: The poison must never be used to harm another women.
Rule #2: The names of the murderer and her victim must be recorded in the apothecary’s register.” There are the two rules that are set in stone and no clients are allowed to break.
“It's okay to change," I interrupted, "but it's not okay to hide, to bury parts of ourselves.”
