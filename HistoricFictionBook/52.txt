From the novel The Marriage of Opposites by Alice Hoffman we get a mix of history and romance. A retelling of the story who gave birth to Camille Pissarro, the Danish-French Impressionist and Neo-Impressionist painter, also known as the Father of Impressionism. Rachel is a strong-willed female character that after being married off to an old widower who suddenly dies, meets Frederick, her late husband’s younger nephew and as we know the rest was history. “Whoever knows you when you are young can look inside you and see the person you once were, and maybe still are at certain times.”
