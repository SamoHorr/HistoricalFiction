This Other Eden by the Pulitzer Prize winning author of 'Tinkers' Paul Harding is a novel inspired by the true story of the once racially integrated Malaga Island off the coast of Maine.
Set in 1792, we follow formerly enslaved Benjamin Honey and his Irish wife Patience, as they discover an island they believe they could make a life together. More than a century later, we see how Honey's descendants are still on the island with a diverse band of neighbors, and how eugenics-minded state officials decide to "cleanse" the island and introduce "civilization" to save the inhabitants from themselves.
